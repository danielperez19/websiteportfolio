        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Daniel Luke Perez, and I reside in West Covina, California. I graduated in May 2024 from California State University - Pomona with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science. My aspiration is to become a Software Engineer, a goal I am dedicated to achieving through continuous learning and development.</p>
        <p>During my time at university, I was an active member of the Software Engineering Association. Through this club, I collaborated with peers to create a web application called CS-Catalog, a project that honed my skills in web development and teamwork. This experience, coupled with my academic background, has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science principles and practical application.</p>
        <p>Beyond my university projects, I am committed to self-improvement and regularly work on personal programming projects. These endeavors not only sharpen my technical abilities but also demonstrate my passion and dedication to the field of software engineering. I pride myself on being a proactive learner, constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow.</p>
        <p>I am a highly motivated individual with a keen eye for detail and a strong analytical mindset. My problem-solving skills, combined with my collaborative spirit, make me a valuable asset to any team. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to innovative software solutions and am eager to bring my knowledge, skills, and enthusiasm to a dynamic software engineering role.</p>
